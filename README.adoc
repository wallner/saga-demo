= Sagas for Data Integrity in Distributed Systems

This repository contains the source code for my presentation "Sagas für Datenintegrität in verteilten Systemen mit BPMN" ("Sagas for Data integrity in Distributed Systems").

To run it you could run `./gradlew bootRun` that starts the local server at `localhost:8080`.
To place an order the following can be used:

[source,shell]
----
echo '{"customer": "Anton", "description": "Test", "price": {"amount":4.00, "currency":"EUR"}}' \
| http post :8080/order
----
